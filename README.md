Thanks for using durabilite.ai calculator! This is a project with a lineage from the EcoLogits Calculator. The README file is still under work. 

To install this project, use 

```sh
uv lock
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt #for local installation, this is easier to manage the discrepency between the Ecologits used here and the one available on the official Ecologits repo.
uv pip install -r requirements.txt #for deploying on vercel.
```

To run it, do
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
